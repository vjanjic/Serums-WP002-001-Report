USPHR is a mechanism to create and manage electronic patient records for individual patients in a secure and transparent way, centralising a golden source of health information. It will overcome the current challenges arising from managing different formats of the diverse electronic patient records present in different institutions/scenarios by creating a universal format that will be applicable in a variety of situations. The USPHR provides mechanisms for tracking the lineage and provenance of the data using a blockchain approach. It will provide a fundamental core structure for the mechanisms from WP3, WP4, and WP5.
