In this chapter, we discuss the concept of Universal Smart Patient Health Record, the aim of which is to provide a general way of representing the patient data that will cover a variety of uses and scenarios, and that will also be machine readable to allow its usage in data fabrication and blockchain technology. In Section~\ref{sec:usphr}, we discuss requirements for format of such universal patient record. we then (Section~\ref{sec:dataVault}) introduce a well-known concept from data science, \emph{data vault}, which we propose to use as this universal format. We then (Section~\ref{sec:cancerData}) describe the format in which the data of the use case described in~\ref{sec:usecase} was originally stored, create a database schema out of it and discuss how the data can be reorganised into data vault. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:dataCorrelation}, we discuss how we can establish correlation between values of different fields of the patient records (e.g.~whether particular value in one field necessarily implies a particular value, or a range of values, in other field), which is necessary for deriving precise rules required for data fabrication infrastructure of WP4, for generating synthetic but realistic data.

This Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) shows the details for the first source system from University of St Andrews the team use to show how the sources system is stored in its native form in the health care ecosystem.

\section{Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5)}

Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a set of file formats of which HDF5 is the version 5. It is design with basic principals to store and organise large amounts of data. \ref{fig:figHDF5} \cite{Folk2011}

The research project is using a \href{https://pypi.org/project/h5py/}{H5Py} library to build and maintain the data.

The record is structured using HDF groups that supports the core hubs of the data vault.

These hubs are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Time
    
    The project support ISO 8601-1:2019 (\url{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:8601:-1:ed-1:v1:en})
    and ISO 8601-2:2019 Notation 
    (\url{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:std:iso:8601:-2:ed-1:v1:en})
    for date format. \\
    Datetime with time zone (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.nnnnnn+|-hh:mm)
    
    
    \item Person
    Core information on the persons involve in the health-care process.
    These can be patient, medical staff or other authorised persons.
    The role of the person is determine by a person role type in the hub.
    
    \item Object
    Core information on the objects involve in the health-care process.
    These can be blood samples, hospital beds etc.
    The role of the object is determine by a object role type in the hub.
    
    \item Location
    Core information on the locations involve in the health-care process.
    Project supports ISO 6709:2008 Standard. (\url{https://www.iso.org/standard/39242.html})
    
    
    The location is to one thousandth of a latitude and longitude (i.e. to less than one square meter).
    The role of the location is determine by a location role type in the hub.
    Suggestion currently is a single type: latitude-longitude.
    
    \item Event
    Core information on the events involve in the health-care process.
    The role of the event is determine by a event role type in the hub.
    Examples of events:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Patient visit to doctor.
        \item Patient takes medical test.
        \item Patient performs Physiotherapy exercise with sensors attached.
        \item Patient answer Prompts on Quality of Life question.
    \end{itemize}
    
    
\end{itemize}
