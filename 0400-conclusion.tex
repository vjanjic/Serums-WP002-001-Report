The current \emph{Smart Patient Record}\ref{chap:sphf} is version 001.000 and will evolve over the period of the research of Serums project. The team for \emph{Smart Patient Record} version 001.001 plan to include other research use cases identified by the consortium. The \emph{Smart Patient Record} will evolve as the researchers add extra use cases but WP2 do not foresee any major change to the Universal Smart Patient Record's core structure.
